## Overview

This is a first-cut repo containing an attempt at automating some of the examples presented by Ken Smith in his write-up [here](https://yogiken.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/c-register-access.pdf), and lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrrQaa_-hzU). There are also elements taken from some random [articles](https://www.embedded.com/design/prototyping-and-development/4023817/Interrupts-in-C-) on interrupt handling in C++. As a basic precaution, this code is still reflective of my attempt to learn how to best slot C++ into my embedded development, so some of my solutions may be err.. highly non-optimal. Additionally, a large part of the startup code and exception handling is predicated on use on Cortex-M chips where use of assembler can be largely if not completely eliminated.
